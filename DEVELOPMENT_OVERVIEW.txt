RATHER BUGS:
TODO: add attribute "last edit time" to xElements and xLists => could be used for trash
TODO: instead of prompting user on entering same name, just add index: name-(index)
TODO: make ElemViewHolder and ListViewHolder encapsulated
TODO: handle updating of xElem and xList positions more elegantly ( in the onDestroy methods (exit) of the activities/fragments (if searchbar wasnt active))
TODO: SDK <=19 => padding on edges is weird and elevation stops working
TODO: Can choose non image for cropping (no possible to fix by me I think)
